The whole TP is compiled from a makefile, so just type the following command:

make

Then, for the execution :

./exe

Otherwise, it will be possible to use options according to the encryption methods (see the help with ./exe --help). 
There is no order to respect for the options, the program will run anyway and it is possible to omit some of them.
